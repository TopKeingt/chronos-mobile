Smart alarm that automatically set an accurate time to get to your destination on time without being late due to traffic and weather.

### Description
We've all been there, planned everything out and still arrive late. Why? Traffic! According to statistics, late arrival due to unexpected traffic accounts for nearly 40% of all the causes, making it the number one leading cause of late arrival. With Chronos, you'll be reminded of the most accurate time to leave based on route, weather, AND traffic. Therefore, completely eliminating the "Traffic held me up" excuse.

**Inspired by [Chronos](https://github.com/jackwilliams2480/Chronos).** A project that me and my team worked on during Blueprint 2019 hackathon.
